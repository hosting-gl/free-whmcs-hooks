## Available Hooks

### Disk Usage Warning Hook

This hook provides disk usage warnings in the WHMCS admin area when viewing clients. If any product's disk usage exceeds the defined thresholds (80% for a soft warning, 90% for a hard warning), the system displays warnings on specific admin pages related to that client.

By using this hook, you’ll get a clear view of which clients are nearing or exceeding their disk limits, allowing you to manage resources efficiently.
